# Guitar Scale Practice
This project provides a guitarist exercises to better their navigation around the freboard.

In contrast to the piano, like many stringed instruments, it has a weird, segmented visualization of scales. The piano visualizes sheet music in a one-to-one correspondence. Meaning, notes only travel one direction:
 - Left to right for the piano 
 - Bottom to top for sheet music

No notes repeat...

With the guitar, however, notes DO repeat. With standard tuning EADGBe, the 5th fret at the low E string is the same note as the open A string. This is occurs with all the other strings, except for the G string and the B string, where the *4th* fret of the 3rd string is identical to the open 2nd string. While it seems like this redundancy is unnecessary, this actually allows for a chords of wider range. The notes are placed **left to right** AND **bottom to top**.
